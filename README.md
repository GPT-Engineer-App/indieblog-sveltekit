# indieblog-sveltekit

An IndieWeb personal blog system built with SvelteKit (using TypeScript). The project should support standard blog features such as creating, editing, and displaying blog posts. Additionally, it should integrate IndieWeb principles, allowing for things like webmentions and owning one's content online. The interface should be clean and minimalistic, with a focus on readability and easy navigation. User authentication for the blog owner to manage posts is also required.
